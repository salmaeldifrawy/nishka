    <p> <h3> Nishkas own words    </h3>   </p>
    <p> <h5> prom is a nuance because there are parts that are enjoyable and there are parts that are not enjoyable.
       the parts that are not enjoyable is finding a date because men are trash so just take ur friend. they wont disappoint.
     personally i had an okay time. dont let other people who dont attend ur school come to ur prom because they will take charge
   of your photographer and ruin ur pics and thats bad. You need good pics because did u even go to prom if u didnt post it?</h3> </p>
    <p> <h3>  More things you dont care about </h3>  </p>
    <p> <h5> i got my hair done and did my own make up because i think hair is more important uk?
    <div> there was a chocolate fountain at my prom
    <div> tickets were $60 and it was worth it (developers comments: no it wasnt)</h3> </p>
